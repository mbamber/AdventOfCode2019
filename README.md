# Solutions to the [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) Puzzles

To obtain the solutions for a given day, run `make solve DAY=X PART=Y` where `X` corresponds to a solved day, and `Y` corresponds to a part (either `1` or `2`).

The programs assumes the input is available at `./inputs/dayX.input` but this can be overriden using the `INPUT=` argument to `make`.
